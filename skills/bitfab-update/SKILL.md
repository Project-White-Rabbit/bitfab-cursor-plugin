# Bitfab Update

Update the Bitfab Cursor plugin and/or every workspace's SDK in the current project.

| Invocation | What runs |
|---|---|
| `/bitfab-update` or `/bitfab-update all` | Plugin update **and** SDK update per workspace |
| `/bitfab-update plugin` | Plugin update only, skips all SDK steps |
| `/bitfab-update sdk` | SDK update only, skips the plugin check |

**CLI commands** available via Bash (all paths relative to `${CURSOR_PLUGIN_ROOT:-${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}}/dist/commands/`):

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `update.js <mode>` | Run the plugin/SDK update script (checks versions, installs latest) |

## Modes

Read `$ARGUMENTS` first. If its first token is exactly one of the mode names below, run that mode. Otherwise, when this skill documents how to route the remaining arguments (see its intro), follow that; if it doesn't, run `all` and treat `$ARGUMENTS` as its input. Run only that mode's section below and skip the others.

| Mode | Trigger | What it does |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `all` | `all` (default) | Update both the Bitfab plugin and the SDK to the latest versions. |
| `plugin` | `plugin` | Update only the Bitfab plugin to the latest version. |
| `sdk` | `sdk` | Update only the Bitfab SDK to the latest version. |

## Setup

1. Pass the mode argument the user invoked through to the script (omit for the default `all`):

   ```bash
   node "${CURSOR_PLUGIN_ROOT:-${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}}/dist/commands/update.js" <mode>
   ```

   - For `/bitfab-update plugin`, run with `plugin`.
   - For `/bitfab-update sdk`, run with `sdk`.
   - For `/bitfab-update` or `/bitfab-update all`, run with no argument (or `all`).

   The script does up to two things depending on mode:
   - **Plugin phase** (`all` or `plugin`), updates the plugin if a newer version is available.
   - **SDK phase** (`all` or `sdk`), queries the registry for the latest SDK version and prints a `<bitfab-sdk-status>` block with one JSON entry per `(workspace, language)` pair. Falls back to the baked snapshot (set `remoteCheckFailed: true`) if the registry lookup fails.

## Update plugin

**Run only when mode is `all` or `plugin`.**

1. If the plugin was updated, remind the user to restart Cursor to apply the update. If the mode was `plugin`, stop here; do not run any step of the SDK phase.

## Update SDK

**Run only when mode is `all` or `sdk`.**

1. Each line inside `<bitfab-sdk-status>` is a JSON object with fields:

   - `workspacePath`, relative path of the workspace from the repo root (`"."` for non-monorepos or the root package itself)
   - `language`, `"typescript" | "python" | "ruby" | "go"`
   - `packageName`, the canonical SDK package name (`@bitfab/sdk`, `bitfab-py`, `bitfab`, `github.com/Project-White-Rabbit/bitfab-go`)
   - `declaredVersion`, the range from the workspace's manifest. May be `null` or a loose range.
   - `resolvedVersion`, the exact version from the lockfile (workspace's own lockfile, or the monorepo root lockfile used as fallback). This is the truth, what the user is actually running.
   - `current`, `resolvedVersion ?? declaredVersion`. Use this for user-facing messages.
   - `latest`, the latest published version (from the source indicated by `latestSource`)
   - `latestSource`, `"remote"` (fetched live from the registry) or `"baked"` (snapshot from the plugin build)
   - `remoteCheckFailed`, `true` when the live registry lookup failed; trigger the agent fallback (step 3)
   - `updateAvailable`, `true` when `latest > current` OR when `renameFrom` is set (package rename needed)
   - `renameFrom`, when non-null (e.g. `"bitfab"`), the workspace uses the legacy package name and must be switched to `packageName` (`@bitfab/sdk`). The update step should remove the old package and install the new one, then update imports in source files.
   - `deprecated`, `true` when the workspace uses the legacy `bitfab` package name instead of `@bitfab/sdk`. Equivalent to `renameFrom !== null`; kept for backward compatibility.
   - `manifestPath` / `lockfilePath`, absolute paths of the files the info came from

   If there are **no lines** inside `<bitfab-sdk-status>`, the programmatic check found no SDK, but don't stop yet, run step 2 first. After that step, distinguish two cases:

   - **No SDK anywhere** (no lines AND step 2 found no imports): the project isn't instrumented yet. Tell the user the Bitfab SDK isn't installed and suggest running `/bitfab-setup` to instrument the project. Stop.
   - **SDKs present and current** (every entry has `updateAvailable: false` AND step 2 finds no extras): tell the user their SDKs are up to date and stop.
2. The programmatic detection is regex-based and only knows the workspace formats we hand-coded (pnpm/npm/yarn workspaces, uv workspaces, go.work). It can miss unusual monorepo layouts, vendored SDKs, or projects using package managers we don't parse. **Always run this verification** before offering updates.

   - Grep the project for SDK imports (run these in parallel):
     - TypeScript: `import .* from ["'](?:@bitfab/sdk|bitfab)["']` or `require\(["'](?:@bitfab/sdk|bitfab)["']\)`
     - Python: `^\s*(from|import) bitfab\b`
     - Ruby: `require ['"]bitfab['"]`
     - Go: `"github.com/Project-White-Rabbit/bitfab-go"`
   - For each import, find its workspace directory by walking up to the nearest `package.json` / `pyproject.toml` / `Gemfile` / `go.mod`.
   - Compare that set against the `workspacePath` values in `<bitfab-sdk-status>`.
   - For each workspace that has imports but **no** corresponding status entry, treat it as a missed detection: ask the user which package manager that workspace uses, then go to step 3 for it (same flow as `remoteCheckFailed: true`).
   - If the sets match, proceed.
3. For each entry where `remoteCheckFailed: true`, or any workspace discovered only in step 2, run the package manager's native outdated command from the workspace directory. The command is authoritative, it respects private registries, mirrors, and offline caches.

   | Language | Detection (from workspace/repo) | Command (run from workspace dir) |
   |---|---|---|
   | typescript | `pnpm-lock.yaml` at repo root → pnpm; `yarn.lock` → yarn; `bun.lock` → bun; otherwise npm | `pnpm outdated @bitfab/sdk --json` / `npm outdated @bitfab/sdk --json` / `yarn outdated @bitfab/sdk` / `bun outdated @bitfab/sdk` |
   | python | `uv.lock` → uv; `poetry.lock` → poetry; otherwise pip | `uv pip list --outdated --format=json` / `poetry show -o bitfab-py` / `pip list --outdated --format=json` |
   | ruby | `Gemfile.lock` | `bundle outdated bitfab --parseable` |
   | go | `go.mod` | `go list -m -u -json github.com/Project-White-Rabbit/bitfab-go` |

   Use the real latest from the command's output in place of `latest` when deciding whether to offer an upgrade.
4. If there are **3 or more** workspaces with `updateAvailable: true`, ask with `AskUserQuestion` : **one decision per question**:

   > A) **Update all N outdated workspaces** *(recommended)* → step 7
   > B) **Ask me per workspace** → step 5
   > C) **Skip everything** → stop

   **Always recommend "Update all" (option A).** Do not downgrade the recommendation based on the range specifier or lockfile shape, not for `workspace:*` / `workspace:^`, not for git refs, not for pinned `"=X.Y.Z"`, not for path deps. An outdated SDK is an outdated SDK. If the user is working inside a monorepo where the dep is workspace-linked to a sibling SDK package, they are free to pick **Skip** themselves, but the recommended action is still **Update**.

   If there are **fewer than 3** outdated workspaces, skip this prompt and go straight to per-workspace.
5. For the next workspace with `updateAvailable: true`, ask with `AskUserQuestion` : **one decision per question**:

   > We recommend **Update**: `<workspacePath>`, `<language>` SDK `<current>` → `<latest>`.
   > If `renameFrom` is set, append: (also renames `<renameFrom>` → `<packageName>`)
   >
   > A) **Update**: run the package manager update command now *(recommended)* → step 6
   > B) **Skip**: leave this workspace on `<current>` → step 5

   When no outdated workspaces remain, exit and acknowledge.
6. Detect the package manager from the lockfiles and run the update **from the workspace directory** (not repo root, matters in monorepos):

   | Language | Command |
   |---|---|
   | typescript | If `renameFrom` is set (legacy `bitfab` package): remove the old package and add the new one in a single command: `pnpm remove bitfab && pnpm add @bitfab/sdk@latest` / `npm uninstall bitfab && npm install @bitfab/sdk@latest` / `yarn remove bitfab && yarn add @bitfab/sdk@latest` / `bun remove bitfab && bun add @bitfab/sdk@latest`. Then update imports in source files from `bitfab` to `@bitfab/sdk`. If no rename: `pnpm update @bitfab/sdk@latest` / `yarn upgrade @bitfab/sdk@latest` / `bun update @bitfab/sdk` / `npm install @bitfab/sdk@latest` |
   | python | `uv add bitfab-py@latest` / `poetry add bitfab-py@latest` / `pip install -U bitfab-py` (and bump the pin in `requirements.txt` via Edit) |
   | ruby | `bundle update bitfab` |
   | go | `go get github.com/Project-White-Rabbit/bitfab-go@latest && go mod tidy` |

   After the update, Read the manifest to verify the new version and confirm to the user. If a rename was performed (`renameFrom` was set), also grep the workspace for old import paths and update them (e.g. `from "bitfab"` to `from "@bitfab/sdk"`). Then return to the per-workspace prompt for the next workspace.
7. For every workspace with `updateAvailable: true`, detect the package manager from the lockfiles and run the update **from each workspace directory** (not repo root):

   | Language | Command |
   |---|---|
   | typescript | If `renameFrom` is set (legacy `bitfab` package): remove the old package and add the new one in a single command: `pnpm remove bitfab && pnpm add @bitfab/sdk@latest` / `npm uninstall bitfab && npm install @bitfab/sdk@latest` / `yarn remove bitfab && yarn add @bitfab/sdk@latest` / `bun remove bitfab && bun add @bitfab/sdk@latest`. Then update imports in source files from `bitfab` to `@bitfab/sdk`. If no rename: `pnpm update @bitfab/sdk@latest` / `yarn upgrade @bitfab/sdk@latest` / `bun update @bitfab/sdk` / `npm install @bitfab/sdk@latest` |
   | python | `uv add bitfab-py@latest` / `poetry add bitfab-py@latest` / `pip install -U bitfab-py` (and bump the pin in `requirements.txt` via Edit) |
   | ruby | `bundle update bitfab` |
   | go | `go get github.com/Project-White-Rabbit/bitfab-go@latest && go mod tidy` |

   After each update, Read the manifest to verify the new version and confirm to the user. If a rename was performed (`renameFrom` was set), also grep the workspace for old import paths and update them (e.g. `from "bitfab"` to `from "@bitfab/sdk"`).
